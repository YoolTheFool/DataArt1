# DataArt - section 1. 
## Assignment - 3 data vis

The dataset - reflects the foreign-born population of the entire US. This assignment was a good opportunity for me re-kindle my Javascript abilities (which are not great). Quickly, I decided to take a few of my previous p5 sketches and try to work with them. The problem started when the instrument i.e the sketches, became the main concern, and not the representation of a conceptual piece.Eventually, the work paid off (meaning that I learned how to approach a dataset with Javascript, not that it came out nicely). Looking at the data set I thought simple - I want to show the difference in scale between the countries. That difference was not easy on the mapping since I needed to find the sweet-spot so that the large numbers won't saturate and the small ones won't evaporate.
Having said that I had created two and a half presentations for this particular dataset.

## First Vis
Each country is represented by a circle being pulled to the "ground". The estimation numbers are being used as diameters for the circles
