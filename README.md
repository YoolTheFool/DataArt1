# DataArt - section 1. 
## Assignment - 3 data vis

The dataset - reflects the foreign-born population of the entire US. This assignment was a good opportunity for me re-kindle my Javascript abilities (which are not great). Quickly, I decided to take a few of my previous p5 sketches and try to work with them. The problem started when the instrument i.e the sketches, became the main concern, and not the representation of a conceptual piece.Eventually, the work paid off (meaning that I learned how to approach a dataset with Javascript, not that it came out nicely). Looking at the data set I thought simple - I want to show the difference in scale between the countries. That difference was not easy on the mapping since I needed to find the sweet-spot so that the large numbers won't saturate and the small ones won't evaporate.
Having said that I had created two and a half presentations for this particular dataset.

## First Vis - animation

Each country is represented by a circle being placed randomally and then pulled to the "ground". The estimation numbers are being used as diameters for the circles. The circles appear every secound or so, so you can distinct between the circles. I made it fast so that the whole process won't be too long and also I wanted to make the visualization very abrupt and overwhelming. After all the circles have been dropped - There is this steady/unsteady state of all circles (nations) "jitterring" on the same level - We will always be foreigners in the US. 

## Second vis - Snapshot
In this instance, I created a "postcard" for each country, and represent individually how each nationality splatters on the Amrican society. This is not a wholistic representation, but rather a one time snapshot of one nationality at a time.
